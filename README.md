Hi! 👋🏻 I’m Chris.

# Projects

You can see a [list of projects on my personal site](https://cmbuckley.co.uk/projects/).

Recently I created the project **[setcookie.net](https://setcookie.net)** to help people demo and understand browser cookies.

I also spend some time working on [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation in my [home repository](https://github.com/cmbuckley/home).
